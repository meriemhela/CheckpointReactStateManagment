# What You're Aiming For

  Develop a To-Do List Application

## Description:
  Create a simple To-Do List application using React that demonstrates various aspects of state management . The application should allow users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, implement form validation for adding/editing tasks and utilize browser storage to persist the tasks between sessions.

## Deliverables:
A React application that fulfills the requirements outlined below. (check instructions)

  - Code should be well-structured, with separate components for different parts of the application (e.g., TaskList, TaskForm, TaskItem).
  - Include comments in the code to explain the purpose of each component and function.
  - Provide a brief README.md file explaining how to run the application locally and any additional information or considerations.

# Instructions

  - Implement a form for adding new tasks. The form should include input fields for task name and description, and it should perform validation to ensure that both fields are filled before adding a task.
  - Display the list of tasks with options to edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks should be visually distinguished from active tasks.
  - Allow users to edit task details by clicking on the task. Implement a form pre-filled with task details that enables users to update task name and description.
  - Provide functionality to delete tasks from the list. Include a confirmation prompt before deleting a task.
  - Implement browser storage (localStorage or sessionStorage) to persist the tasks between sessions. Ensure that tasks are loaded from storage when the application initializes and saved to storage whenever there is a change in the task list.
  - Style the application using CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. Use appropriate styling to highlight active and completed tasks.
  * Optional: Implement additional features such as filtering tasks based on completion status, sorting tasks by priority or due date, or adding due dates to tasks.

# Running the Application
To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
